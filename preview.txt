My multi-page website project is progressing smoothly. All of the web pages have been created and each page correctly navigates to the others. I centered the background image and the navigation bar. I think that the light blue background looks good. I may add a page about universities in the state, but for now my current pages seem like they will require a decent amount of work. The website is meant to be easy to read. I chose these topics because I believe that most visitors will be looking for the selected topics. The Pennsylvania pattern is meant to be a background and border image for the website. I will have to resize it in order for the pages to be easier to read. It will remain a background on all pages because it is central to the theme of the website. From here, I plan to add content to each page. It will require some basic research. Each page will have a brief paragraph/multiple sentences that will describe a certain aspect of the topics. 2-3 sentences will follow each entry. I have to brainstorm what entries I want to feature and what brief text I will attach to each one. I need to source some simple pictures which will be featured next to each entry. There will be 20-30 in total. I will most likely use search.creativecommons.org to source these thumbnails/images. I believe that the website will be successful in meeting its goals. Without paragraphs and explanations, it is obvious what the central mission of the project is. There is plenty of room to experiment with css techniques. Currently the website is bare, but I will make it more visually appealing and I feel that this will be a straightforward task. I believe that this is a good start towards my final submission.
