My website was created to educate people on the many things to do in Pennsylvania. This is a very rough draft. I need to add pictures to each paragraph. These pics will be written as a magazine style. I will then have to add these to my assets file. There is plenty of room to improve the project. I also need to center the paragraphs and make sure my splash page is renamed index.html
